Odin Project rock paper scissors project

I recently finished this project. I struggled with it a lot and relied heavily on my dad's coding knowledge, my friends for help troubleshooting, and strangers who had written RPS scripts to figure out what I was doing wrong. I'm not thrilled with what I've put out, but I need to move on and come back to this later. Assuming I do that, I'd like to rely on other people less when rewriting the script.

I don't care for JS at the moment, but I hope I get past that and start enjoying it as I understand it better.

Cheers.
